# Python Analysis & ETL

Python is used in this project for:
- Data preparation and feature engineering
- Validating SQL-based RFM metrics
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Exporting curated datasets for Tableau dashboards

SQL serves as the source of truth for final business metrics,
while Python is used for flexibility, validation, and explanation.
